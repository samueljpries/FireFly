| Name | Description | Default value |
|------|-------------|---------------|
|**ESP_HAL_PLACE_SPI_DRIVER_IN_RAM**|Places the SPI driver in RAM for better performance|false|
|**ESP_HAL_SPI_ADDRESS_WORKAROUND**|(ESP32 only) Enables a workaround for the issue where SPI in half-duplex mode incorrectly transmits the address on a single line if the data buffer is empty.|true|
|**ESP_HAL_PLACE_SWITCH_TABLES_IN_RAM**|Places switch-tables, some lookup tables and constants related to interrupt handling into RAM - resulting in better performance but slightly more RAM consumption.|true|
|**ESP_HAL_PLACE_ANON_IN_RAM**|Places anonymous symbols into RAM - resulting in better performance at the cost of significant more RAM consumption. Best to be combined with `place-switch-tables-in-ram`.|false|
